Thank you for helping us reach even more people around the world by adapting the experience to their native language.

How does this work?

We will break down the site into the pages and translate one page at the time.

WHY WE NEED YOU
Folding@home is a project focused on disease research. The problems we’re solving require so many computer calcul­ations – and we need your help to find the cures!

FIGHT DISEASES TOGETHER WITH US.
The Folding@home software allows you to share your unused computer power with us – so that we can research even more potential cures.

FOLDING?
Folding refers to the way human protein folds in the cells that make up your body. We rely on the proteins to keep us healthy and they assemble themselves by folding. But when they misfold, there can be serious consequences to a person’s health.

TEAM
Folding@home is now based at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, under the directorship of  Dr. Greg Bowman. Drs. John Chodera (MSKCC) and Vince Voelz (Temple University) are also active in helping manage the project. Together, their three labs are the primary drivers of Folding@home.
