#"is a distributed computing project for simulating protein dynamics, including the process of protein folding and the movements of proteins implicated in a variety of diseases. It brings together citizen scientists who volunteer to run simulations of protein dynamics on their personal computers. Insights from this data are helping scientists to better understand biology, and providing new opportunities for developing therapeutics."
"是模拟蛋白质动力学的一个分布式计算项目，包括蛋白质折叠的过程和涉及多种疾病的蛋白质运动过程。它聚集了自愿参与并在其个人计算机上进行蛋白质动力学模拟的公民科学家们。从这些数据中获取的规律正在帮助科学家们更好地了解生物学，并为开发新的治疗方法提供了新的机会。"
