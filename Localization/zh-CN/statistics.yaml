# "One of the best ways to help Folding@home is by recruiting your friends and family. Start by sharing our project with them. Then join a team or even start your own team. The more points your team earns, the closer we come to finding cures.

# On this page you will find access to statistics for individuals and teams who have joined together to earn points and compete with other teams. Some of us are quite intense in our approach to folding. We have team websites, we soup up our computers, and we drive the technology forward by reporting bugs and making suggestions about how to improve the software.",

"帮助Folding@home其中一种最佳方式是招募您的朋友和家人。从与他们分享我们的项目开始。然后加入一个小组或者创建您自己的小组。您的小组获取的点数越多，那么我们就离发现治疗的方法越近。

在这个页面您可以访问不同的个人或团队协同合作获取点数并与其他小组进行竞争的数据。我们中部分人对这种得到折叠的方式态度很强烈[needs correction]。我们有团队网页，优化已有的计算资源，并且通过报告软件的缺陷以及改进软件来向前驱动这项技术。",
